I'm a Azure Consultant with a severe crush on Powershell. I strongly believe, that almost any workload can be moved to a Cloud service. Wether that service is Azure, AWS or Google Cloud is of less importance, since they all are accessible via my favorite tool.

Even if you don't trust the Cloud, you most certainly still need to automate a lot of tasks, if you don't want to drown in next-clicking. Powershell is the perfect tool for automating anything based on Microsoft platforms. It can even automate anyhing on any other platofrm, as long as it has some sort of interface.

I have automated tons of stuff with Powershell. Just to name a few:
* Teams
* Lotus Notes
* Entrust
* SharePoint
* Office 365
* AX2012
* Cisco
* Various websites
* Mainframe
* Filesystem
* Acive Directory

For the last 8 years I have been focused on Azure Infrastructure - specifically CAF Enterprise Scale and Bicep deployments along with Data Platforms build on Azure Serverless technology like Azure Functions, Synapse Workspace, Azure Data Lake and Azure SQL Databases. In the later years, I'm drifting more and more to C#, but PowerShell will always be my primary driver.

Actually I'm pretty sure that, if you can click it, I can automate it.
